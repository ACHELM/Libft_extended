# Libft_extended

The Libft_extended project aims to rewrite the original 42school libft project
in a more efficient way and less technical comments than the bash manual, as well
as to add new features that may be useful during the course of 42 inner-core projects.

This project is still being expanded and all sugerences for its improvement are welcome,
if you have any doubt, you can contact me via my Slack user for the 42 Network (@aalvarez),
or via my student mail (aalvarez@student.42urduliz.com).
